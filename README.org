* Some guix packages
  This is a very unofficial personal set of packages for [[https://guix.gnu.org/][gnu guix]].
  Many packages are works in progress, some might not work correctly.
  I just thought I'd share my work and see if anyone can help ;) ;) ;)
** Working
   - bower (needs tweaks)
   - dhall-json
   - ghc-servant
   - ghc-*
   - idump
   - libsixel
   - ormolu
   - pijul
   - spago
   - sdump
   - yaft
   - tealdeer
** In progress
   - termonad
   - urweb (waiting for upstream MLton)
** Now with more stability
  I figured I would try to make this channel more consumable.
  Breaking changes will now be made in separate branches.
